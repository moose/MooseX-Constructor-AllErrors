=head1 NAME

MooseX::Constructor::AllErrors - Capture all constructor errors

=head1 VERSION

version 0.025

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package MyClass;
  use MooseX::Constructor::AllErrors;

  has foo => (is => 'ro', required => 1);
  has bar => (is => 'ro', isa => 'Int');

  ...

  eval { MyClass->new(bar => "hello") };
  # $@->errors has two errors, not just the missing required attribute

=head1 DESCRIPTION

MooseX::Constructor::AllErrors tries to capture every error generated during
the construction of your objects, rather than halting after the first.

If there are errors, C<$@> will contain a
L<MooseX::Constructor::AllErrors::Error::Constructor> object.  See its
documentation for possible error types.
