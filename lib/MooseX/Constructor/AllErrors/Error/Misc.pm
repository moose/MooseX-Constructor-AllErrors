=head1 NAME

MooseX::Constructor::AllErrors::Error::Misc - represents a miscellaneous error

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents an error occurring at construction time that cannot be
classified as one of the other error types.  The error message is an arbitrary
string, which describes the nature of the error.

Its creation is a little different than the other error types - it must be
explicitly created by the generating class, usually in either C<BUILDARGS> or
C<BUILD>:

    sub BUILD
    {
        my ($self, $args) = @_;

        my @errors;

        # either name *or* id is required
        push @errors, MooseX::Constructor::AllErrors::Error::Misc->new(
            message => 'Either \'name\' or \'id\' must be provided',
        ) if not defined $args->{name} and not defined $args->{id};

        ...;

        if (@errors)
        {
            my $error = MooseX::Constructor::AllErrors::Error::Constructor->new(
                caller => [ caller( Class::MOP::class_of($this)->is_immutable ? 2 : 4) ],
            );
            $error->add_error($_) foreach @errors;
            die $error;
        }
    }

This code is a little long and unwieldy; it is likely that a shortcut will soon
be added; it has been suggested that support for a VALIDATE sub be added, which
is automatically called at construction time before BUILD, to perform
validations with no side effect. Stay tuned to upcoming releases!
